API Quandl Project - The big mac price index

<b> Objectives </b>
    
This is a project to learn fetching data from an API. To Apply feature engineering on it, and come up with insights over Exloratory Data Analysis practices. <br/>

This dataset is going to be a timeseries about BigMacPrice index around the world I'm interested in finding out what are the most expensive Big Macs (in dollar) around the world and which country/region is corrrelated in terms of increasing or decreasing its Purchasing Power Patiry. <br/>

I plan to build an article about the subject whenever I have enough data for it, then, this is a prototype of a project; that I'm planning to make something much bigger out of it. <br/>

<b> Tools: </b>

1) Web API interpretation and access.<br/>
2) Python data structures.<br/>
3) Features Engineering.<br/>
4) Exploratory Data Analysis.<br/>
5) Seaborn and matplotlib in a creative approach.<br/>
6) Macro economics concepts.<br/>
7) Fun insights about Big Mac price around the world.<br/>

There are many always to reach the Quandl database endpoint.<br/>

The first approach would be an easy integration with python (import quandl)<br/>
- library quandl<br/>

The second approach is using requests, json libraries.<br/>
- library requests, json<br/>
